When working with Braintrust, prefer the `bt` CLI for auth and data access.

Use:
- `bt login status` for credential checks
- `bt projects list` for project discovery
- `bt view logs` / `bt view trace` for observability
- `bt prompts list|view` for prompts

Prefer `--json` for machine-readable output when chaining tools.
