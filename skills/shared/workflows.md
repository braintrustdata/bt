Use these product workflow categories when deciding how to help users:

- `Instrument`: SDK setup, spans/logging, metadata capture, tracing patterns.
- `Observe`: logs/traces inspection, dashboards, debugging production behavior.
- `Annotate`: feedback labels, human review loops, curation workflows.
- `Evaluate`: dataset/test-case based evals, scoring, regressions, guardrails.
- `Deploy`: prompt/version rollout, environment promotion, runtime controls.

When uncertain, prefer precise `bt` CLI commands for local operations, and use docs context to
explain product concepts and recommended patterns.
